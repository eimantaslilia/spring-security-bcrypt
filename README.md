# spring-security-bcrypt

This is a sample project to learn more about Spring Security.

We have a simple login page, and we store usernames, passwords and roles in a SQL database.  
Once a user logs in, they can only see the information they are authorized to see by role.  

While doing this project I learned more about:

* Spring Security
* Security Filters
* Authentication and Authorization
* Protection against CSRF
* Restricting access by user roles
* Database authentication
* Password encryption using bcrypt algorithm
* Using Maven for build management and dependencies
* Maven key concepts
